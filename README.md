# Capstone-Project-Falcon-9
SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This supervised classification project was carried out as part of the IBM Data Science Professional certificate.

Presentation of the project
The presentation covers all steps described in Jupyter Notebooks in following sections. From Data Collection, Analysis to prediction of launch succeess (succesful first stage landing) with classification algorithms.
